# Mental Training Bot 🧠

Telegram bot for brain training. Two exercises — Word Memorization (live) and
Audio Visualization (feature-flagged) — wrapped in a gamification layer of XP,
achievements, streaks and an opt-in leaderboard. Built as a training product
for a mental-training community.

## Features

### Word Memorization
- **Formats**: 🔗 Pairs (recall the partner word) | 📜 Word List (sequential chain — each word prompts the next)
- **Modes**: Training (study only) | Test (study → timed disappear → quiz)
- **Difficulty**: Beginner (everyday concrete nouns) | Intermediate (all nouns + verbs) | Advanced (+adjectives)
- **Counts**: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100
- Per-question timer with auto-skip, plus a 2s grace window for answers typed just after a timeout
- Fuzzy matching (Levenshtein ≤2 edits, disabled for short words)
- Retry Mistakes, Reverse quiz (columns flipped), one-tap level-up to the next size
- Speed mode — normal (5s/pair) or fast (2.5s/pair) study time
- Placement test for new users — one 2-minute calibration round recommends a starting level
- Personal bests (per format), progressive difficulty suggestions at ≥90%
- Anti-repeat word selection (rolling 200-word window)
- Daily streak tracking, plus a daily sprint challenge (5 tests at 90%+ inside an hour)

### Audio Visualization
- Narrated stories (1/3/5 min) the user listens to and visualizes; passive by design
- Optional multiple-choice detail quiz afterwards as a proxy score
- Post-listen focus check ("how many times did your mind wander?")
- Drop an `.mp3` (+ optional `.json` sidecar) into `data/audio/` and it's live — no restart
- Own XP bar and achievements; off by default behind a runtime feature flag

### Gamification
- XP and levels per skill bar, with challenge-rating scaling and anti-farm accuracy gates
- 21 achievements, including tiered sets
- Opt-in leaderboard ranked by average score (min 3 tests)
- One-time redemption codes for gating access to paid community members

### Analytics
- Engaged training time recorded per round (study + quiz + listening)
- Raw interaction stream for usage patterns, with an admin kill switch
- `streamlit run dashboard.py` — private dashboard over a database snapshot:
  time on task, commitment vs improvement, where members stall, engagement, per-member drilldown

### Architecture
- Modular exercise system — adding an exercise is a new module plus a registry entry
- Async throughout (python-telegram-bot + SQLAlchemy async), concurrent updates enabled
- SQLite via aiosqlite in WAL mode (PostgreSQL migration planned)
- Features ship behind DB-persisted runtime flags, toggleable without a redeploy

## Setup

### 1. Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram → `@BotFather` → `/newbot`
2. Copy the token

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — add TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Requires **Python 3.12** (3.14 breaks SQLAlchemy + python-telegram-bot).

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | required | Token from BotFather |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./mental_training.db` | DB connection string |
| `BOT_NAME` | `MentalTrainingBot` | Bot display name |
| `MAX_WORD_PAIRS` | `100` | Max pairs per session |
| `DEFAULT_WORD_PAIRS` | `10` | Default pair count |
| `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_IDS` | none | Comma-separated IDs allowed to use `/admin` |

## Adding a New Exercise

1. Create `exercises/your_exercise.py` extending `BaseExercise`
2. Implement: `get_difficulty_keyboard()`, `get_parameter_keyboard()`, `generate()`, `get_intro_message()`
3. Set class attrs: `name`, `description`, `exercise_type`
4. Register in `exercises/registry.py`
5. Add an `ExerciseType` enum value in `database/models.py`
6. Add a callback route in `bot/handlers.py`, with the flow in its own `bot/` module
7. To reuse the shared quiz engine, follow the checklist in `CLAUDE.md`

## Roadmap

Full backlog with build order in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

- [ ] Delayed recall / spaced repetition across both exercises
- [ ] "Story method" bridge exercise — teaches the linking technique explicitly
- [ ] Daily personal recommendations + shareable progress cards
- [ ] More exercise types (number sequences, pattern recognition, mental math)
- [ ] PostgreSQL + Redis migration
- [ ] Subscription enforcement and payment flow
- [x] Leaderboard, achievements, XP levels
- [x] Audio visualization exercise
- [x] Usage analytics + admin dashboard
