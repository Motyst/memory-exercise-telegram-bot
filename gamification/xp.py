"""
Experience / leveling system.

One skill bar live ("mnemonics" — fed by Word Memorization tests). Future
exercises declare their own skill via EXERCISE_SKILLS; each skill gets its own
bar automatically.

Balance model
-------------
Every test has a *challenge rating* (CR):

    CR = pairs × difficulty_mult × speed_mult

Each level has an *expected challenge*. Tests below it earn proportionally
less XP (diminishing returns — the "outgrown" effect); tests at/above it earn
full XP and count toward the hard-streak bonus. So to keep leveling you raise
pairs, difficulty, or speed — exactly the intended progression pressure.

All tuning knobs are the module constants below; see docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.md for
what each one does.
